* What classes does each implementation include? Are the lists the same? | Each has the same classes, CartEntry, ShoppingCart, and Order, but the methods have been reorganized in the second implementation.
* Write down a sentence to describe each class. |
 * CartEntry handles an item added, taking in as parameters its unit price and quantity. It also calculates the price of that CartEntry instance.
 * ShoppingCart manages the list of entries and price of all entries combined.
 * Order stores the constant SALES_TAX and totals the sum of the ShoppingCart plus Sales tax.
* How do the classes relate to each other? It might be helpful to draw a diagram on a whiteboard or piece of paper.
 * Order totals the cost of the ShoppingCart which has a collection of instances of CartEntry.
* What data does each class store? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?
 * CartEntry stores the instance variables unit_price and quantity, which are only used in CartEntry. In the second implementation, it does not have an attribute accessor.
 * ShoppingCart stores the instance variable entries which is a collection of CartEntry instances. In the second implementation, it does not have an attribute accessor.
 * Order stores the constant SALES_TAX. It stores the instance of ShoppingCart.
* What methods does each class have? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?
  * Each has an initialize, but they no longer as attribute reader/writers. The Order total_price method no longer calls instance variables from other classes. It only calls an instance variable of ShoppingCart, which was initialized in Order.
* Consider the Order#total_price method. In each implementation:
  * Is logic to compute the price delegated to "lower level" classes like ShoppingCart and CartEntry, or is it retained in Order?
    * Computing the price is retained in Order.
  * Does total_price directly manipulate the instance variables of other classes?
    * No, only those directly called in Order.
* If we decide items are cheaper if bought in bulk, how would this change the code? Which implementation is easier to modify?
 * This would be easier to change in Implementation B because we would only need to change what is passed into CartEntry unit price and/or quantity.
* Which implementation better adheres to the single responsibility principle?
  * Implementation B better adheres to single responsibility because each class only operates on and calculates its own instance variables.
* Bonus question once you've read Metz ch. 3: Which implementation is more loosely coupled?
  * Implementation B is more loosely coupled. It has less instances of directly calling/naming an instance variable or attribute from other classes or variables.
