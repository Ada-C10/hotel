## Hotel Design Activity

**What classes does each implementation include? Are the lists the same?**

Both implementations have 3 classes by the same names: CartEntry, ShoppingCart, Order.


**Write down a sentence to describe each class.**

CartEntry represents the addition of a given product to a cart, including its price and quantity.

ShoppingCart represents a collection of everything that has been added to a cart.

Order represents the total cost of everything in a given cart, including sales tax.


**How do the classes relate to each other? It might be helpful to draw a diagram on a whiteboard or piece of paper.**

ShoppingCart contains each CartEntry. Order calculates the total of the ShoppingCart after sales tax.


**What data does each class store? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?**

CartEntry: both implementations store the prices and quantities of a given product. In implementation A, those values can be accessed outside of the class due to the attr_accessor whereas in Implementation B, they have to be used locally.

ShoppingCart: both implementations have an array that stores each CartEntry object. In Implementation A, those entries can be accessed outside of the class. Implementation B also has a value for the sum of all entries in the cart.

Order: both implementations store the sum/subtotal, or total price of a complete order (before sales tax). This is calculated differently in each implementation. Implementation A iterates through each price and quantity in @entries. Implementation B calls the #price method from ShoppingCart.


**What methods does each class have? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?**

CartEntry: both implementations have an initialize method. Implementation B also has a price method that returns the subtotal of one particular item.

ShoppingCart: both have an initialize method.

Order: both have an initialize method that creates a new instance of a ShoppingCart. Both also have a total_price method that returns the total of all cart entries plus sales tax. The difference is that the method in Implementation A handles all of the logic for "sum" whereas Implementation B calls the "price" method in the ShoppingCart class.


**Consider the Order#total_price method. In each implementation:**
**Is logic to compute the price delegated to "lower level" classes like ShoppingCart and CartEntry, or is it retained in Order?**

In Implementation A, the logic is retained in Order. In Implementation B, the logic relies on ShoppingCart, which is a lower level class.


**Does total_price directly manipulate the instance variables of other classes?**

In Implementation A, total_price reads @entries from ShoppingCart and @unit_price and @quantity from CartEntry. In Implementation B, total_price does not read instance variables of any other class.


**If we decide items are cheaper if bought in bulk, how would this change the code? Which implementation is easier to modify?**

You would need to add some conditional logic that lowers the :unit_price based on :quantity. Implementation A is harder to modify because that logic would need to be called into account in the CartEntry class and Order class. Implementation B is easier to modify because you would only need to modify the CartEntry class.


**Which implementation better adheres to the single responsibility principle?**

Implementation B.


**Bonus question once you've read Metz ch. 3: Which implementation is more loosely coupled?**

Implementation B.


**changes to hotel**
I had a lot of logic regarding the date within reservation_hub. I can create a separate DateRange class to validate dates and create a date array. It would make my code better because I'd be able to call the DateRange class when booking both, room blocks and reservations. It would not only dry up my code, but also help me better adhere to single responsibility.
