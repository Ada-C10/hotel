1. Consider making these classes into a module
  a.To think about - what is the benefit of putting them in a model?
    -because they are all related?

2. Put a party_name attribute in reservation and block reservation
  a.In real life, it will be another way to access reservations
    -so far can see by date range and by id #

3. Make Admin less dependent on Reservation/Block Reservation
  a. maybe put Reservation.new into argument or make it it's own method by itself.
    -Would love to get some good ideas how to do this

4. Consider modifying request_reservation method to be used by request block,
   and request_reservation_within_block (make it reusable)
   a.maybe dividing up methods will help?
