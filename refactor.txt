Notes from original submission - 9.9.18:

BookingManager methods need to be refactored. A lot of logic is repeated, but I had trouble writing the methods so that both blocks and reservations can use them.

Wrap classes in Hotel module.

Change Calendar#get_all_dates to #all_dates.

Find a better way to organize test data.


Notes from instructor feedback - 9.29.18:

BookingManager and Calendar need the most work. The responsibilities need to be split differently, and they're too tightly coupled.

BookingManager and Block are also tightly coupled.

BookingManager needs a factory method to create Reservations and assign room numbers to them.

One of the classes needs to store the reservations and their room numbers - I think it should be BookingManager.

Replace StandardErrors with custom exceptions in BookingManager and Reservation.

Refactor Reservation#number_of_nights.

Change Block discount case statement to hash.
