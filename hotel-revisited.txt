What is this class's responsibility? You should be able to describe it in a single sentence.
  Reservation: stores check in, check out date, and room number while also calculating the cost for those dates.

  BookingSystem: keeps track of all reservations, assigns room number, checks for overlaps in dates for new booking, list reservations by date and show available rooms.

Is this class responsible for exactly one thing?
  Reservation: Almost. It's perhaps it will be better if it just focuses on dates rather than also keeping track of the room_number as well as calculating the cost.

  BookingSystem: No. It's checking to see if the dates overlap while trying to confirm the client is able to make a reservation for that date range.

Does this class take on any responsibility that should be delegated to "lower level" classes?
  Reservation: Not sure if calculating the cost should go to a lower level class but it this class does need to focus on one responsibility.

  BookingSystem: Yes. Overlaps could go to a date range class.

Is there code in other classes that directly manipulates this class's instance variables?
  Reservation:

  BookingSystem:

How easy is it to follow your own instructions?
  It was easy for me to follow the instructions because I wrote them today but if I looked at it a week from now then it will be difficult to follow because it's not specific.

Do these refactors improve the clarity of your code?
  Yes, if implemented it will reduce the number of responsibilities the booking_system class has right now.


Do you still agree with your previous assesment, or could your refactor be further improved?
  I agree with the previous assessment but there are always ways to refactor for one's code to be improved.
