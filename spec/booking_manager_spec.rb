    # - Completely before. ***THIS is where everything fell apart. I took it out in my final submission and a few things happend when I did. 1. The block closures thruought this spec got messed up. I command-i'ed my way to a bunch of passes and hit submit because of fatigue, I had spent too many hours debugging and I was ready to let the instructors solve this for me and be done with it. Not an excuse, just my explination for why. 2. All the passes were wrong, the errors were actually from my taking ends and putting in the wrong place. Also from failed logic with all my raising error tests. I put back all the tests about conditions when the reservations are supposed to be made. I also rewrote/reviewed my notes on how to write tests and how errors work from a couple weeks ago.
