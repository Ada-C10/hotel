# Every room is identical, and a room always costs $200/night
# The last day of a reservation is the checkout day, so the
# guest should not be charged for that night
# For this wave, any room can be reserved at any time, and
# you don't need to check whether reservations conflict with each other (this will come in wave 2!)
