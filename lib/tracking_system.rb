  #block method idea
  #this method below is going to return a value that can into the Block.rooms << (aka list of rooms in a block), but how/when do i assign these available rooms a block id? Ah i think that i will
  # i will create another method called create_block, call view_available_rooms_on(start_time, end_time) within that
  # and then in that create_block method, update a block status for each room (aka block :A) corresponding to the Block's ID (id: A,B,C etc..)

# The hotel has 20 rooms, and they are numbered 1 through 20
# Every room is identical, and a room always costs $200/night
# The last day of a reservation is the checkout day, so the
# guest should not be charged for that night
# For this wave, any room can be reserved at any time, and
# you don't need to check whether reservations conflict with each other (this will come in wave 2!)
