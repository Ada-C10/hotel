Constraints
The hotel has 20 rooms, and they are numbered 1 through 20
Every room is identical, and a room always costs $200/night
The last day of a reservation is the checkout day, so the guest should not be charged for that night
For this wave, any room can be reserved at any time, and you don't need to check whether reservations conflict with each other (this will come in wave 2!)
