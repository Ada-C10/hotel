# Block: Blocks off rooms at a certain rate during an event.


# User Stories
#
# - As an administrator, I can create a block of rooms
#     - To create a block you need a date range, collection of rooms and a discounted room rate
#     - The collection of rooms should only include rooms that are available for the given date range
#     - If a room is set aside in a block, it is not available for reservation by the general public, nor can it be included in another block
# - As an administrator, I can check whether a given block has any rooms available
# - As an administrator, I can reserve a room from within a block of rooms
#
# ### Constraints
#
# - A block can contain a maximum of 5 rooms
# - When a room is reserved from a block of rooms, the reservation dates will always match the date range of the block
# - All of the availability checking logic from Wave 2 should now respect room blocks as well as individual reservations
