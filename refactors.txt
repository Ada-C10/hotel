Refactors to do:

-Build logic and testing for reserving rooms that are set aside block, even after we make them look
unavailable when we create the block. Where should the block reservation logic go? What else will
need to be changed to make this work? Block reservations might need to added to the room initialize
method.

-In the reservation.rb, is the nights_in_reservation method needed?

-Is the front desk class doing too much work? should some of that be pushed on to other classes?
