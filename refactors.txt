Future changes:
- Move reservation_charge method to reservation class
- Create a primary key or hash value of some kind that tracks
that accompanies each reservation as an attribute
- Stop alternating between party name and guest email. Give every
reservation instance a block party name and a contact information
attribute. For non-block reservations then the block party name
can be nil
- Create csv test data so that spec files will be readable and cleaner.
Tests are very haphazard right now and I'd like to run the tests on a hotel
instance with more bookings.
- move reserve_room and build_reservation to the reservation class
- ? remove build_rooms from the HotelAdmin class and instead have
a method in HotelAdmin that you'd just pass a room into that would
add the room to @rooms. No reason to create the rooms from HotelAdmin??
- Naming Conventions? I feel comfortable with the way I've named things
(other than the fact that I'm not storing the right amount of attributes
for reservations, as mentioned above). Maybe I am too close to the project
at this time to identify the problems with my class and method names.

Questions:
What are the problems with the way I've implemented the block?
Should the blocks be separate instances or a separate class?
If so... why?
