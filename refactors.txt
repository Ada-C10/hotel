Make availability hash for room class? {DateRange: Availability}
Use inheritance for blockrooms class

Make DateRange class?/Date range check method
https://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Range.html#method-i-cover-3F

Figure out what to do about the class method in Reservation (line 8) and BlockRooms (line 9)

Undo dependencies if possible

logic for finding dates not in range:
    if (end_a < start_b) || (start_a > end_b)
      puts "not in range"
    end

Rename hotel something else AdminPortal or something

See page 40 of POODR for lines 20, 35, 118, 151 to dependency inject

If it makes sense to do, try to isolate methods that are dependent on other classes ie. .add_rooms_reserved(reserved_room) (pg 44)

Rewrite initialize methods with args (pg 47)

Wrap method for Reservation initializations (pg 50)

Create Module "Hotel" and wrap that around everything?
