Refactor changes:
  ROOM CLASS
    -add_unavailablity could just be add_reservation. I was trying to keep the two classes completely independent of each other when it probably would have been more simple to add and instance of a reservation to an array in the rooms class
  RESERVATION CLASS
    -date? method... what is the date? It should be a little bit more specific about what its checking and in this case its returning true if a reservation includes the date
    -Couldn't decided if there needed to be a new class for the block reservations. But I allowed the availability to do blocks within my reservation class
    -Look into the methods are they doing to much? I like that my make_reservation method will also handle if someone were trying to reserve the block room, but maybe that's doing too much?
    -The make reservation method will always make a reservation in the first room available for a given date range, but lets say someone wants a particular room, or what if a block of rooms wants to be next to each other if those rooms are available? Maybe adding functionality that would offer solutions to these in the reservation manager. 
  RESERVATION MANAGER CLASS
    -Maybe it should just be called Reservation_Manager instead of MGr
    -I like the names in this class they are specific about what they are performing
