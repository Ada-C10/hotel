Possible changes to Hotel:
- Reduce dependency of method for making Reservation on reserve instance variables?
- Split some of Hotel into smaller methods (like reserve_available_room)
- Combine methods that have overlapping but contradictory options? Combine or link. (ex: @reservations & @room_calendar)
- Change name for BookingManager instance(s) in tests? Sometimes listed as "hotel", other times "manager", etc. Change all to BookingSystem?
- Check more of edge cases
- Too many variables with 'reservation' in title?
- Add check that rooms are not overwritten
