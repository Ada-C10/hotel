- Finish the blocks class.
-- The collection of rooms should only include rooms that are available for the given date range
-- If a room is set aside in a block, it is not available for reservation by the general public, nor can it be included in another block

-- list_available_rooms
-- reservations_by_date_range
-- blocks.rb change to room_block?


- Tests could be better organized:
-- in date_range, most could fit under "date range"
-- Tests could have more edge chases - If no date is passed in,
