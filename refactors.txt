# hotel/refactors.txt
Notes:

data file:
Room hash
Reservation hash


Other classes
DateRange (has behavior and attributes)

it was really easy to move my .from_csv loader from Book to Reservation, make
its a self method, and tests still passed. (which is suspicious, but hey.)

why "hotel" stores "rooms":
hotel should be renamed rooms.
what if the room information changes? what if we add a room?

inheritance seems complicated.
i wanted to make choices within what I know how to do.
otherwise, it's a can of worms.


### TODO: Make sure you can't book the same reservation twice

# assumption: that there won't be that many blocks
