Refactoring ideas:

  BookingSystem might have too many responsibilities so might need to divide it into several classes.

  #make_reservation method has too many responsibilities inside and the if statement is too clumped. Break down the method to several instance methods.

  Use .map instead of .each in #list_reservations_by_date.

  Clean up the tests and organize them so that it's easier to read.
