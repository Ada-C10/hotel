Changes that I could make:
1. In the cases where a room or a block could not be found or were not available to book, I either raised
an error or returned nil. In future changes, I would be more consistent throughout with what to use and when.
2. I would go through each file and check to see if I could further manage dependencies and create single
responsibility classes (Hotel Manager is especially huge)
3. Refactoring the HotelManager#make_reservations method - it currently consists of a bunch of nested if-else
statements and could be written better
4. Further consideration into which variables need/should to be keyword arguments and which should be
positional
5. In terms of naming conventions, I tried my best to make things clear, even if it meant really long method names.
There also aren't that many alternatives to "start_date" aside from "check_in" and may a couple of others. I felt like
I named my classes appropriately and understand the purpose of each.
6. Consider storing rooms with dates instead of giving each room all the dates
